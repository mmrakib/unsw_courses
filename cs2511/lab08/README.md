# Lab 08

## Due: Week 9, Monday, 10:00 am AEDT

[[_TOC_]]

# Aims

**What is this lab aiming to achieve?**

This lab has been rewritten to be able to tackle some of the core design patterns in bite sized pieces. The choice exercise is the old lab and is a great opportunity to practice design thinking. It is a great exercise for those that have some time and want to give it a go or one to keep in mind for exam study.

**Design Patterns and Paradigms**

- Understand and apply the Decorator Pattern
- Work with iterators and understand mechanics of iterators
- Utilise generic programming to generalise data structures

**Asynchronous Design**

- Write thread-safe code by understanding a simple concurrency example

Lab authored by Sienna Archer, Tina Ji, Adam Stucci and Nick Patrikeos.

# Submission

> **Make sure you have committed all of your changes before submitting.**

To submit, push your commits to the **master** branch.

# Marking

When marking your design and programming lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:

- Exercise is submitted on time;
- Code passes pipeline with provided JUnit tests / your tests;
- Code solves the problem and is not a hardcoded solution;
- Code is written cleanly and with good style;
- Solution is well-designed, using the design principles and patterns intended by the activity;
- Answers to theory questions address all aspects of the question;
- Any blog posts are consistent with the code/design being described;
- Reflections and rationale are comprehensive and thoughtful
- Any other requirements are outlined in the problem specification.

Many lab exercises in future weeks will consist of a practical design and programming exercise and a written blog post reflecting on the activity. During marking you should bring up your code and your blog post and talk through your solution, thought process and reflections using your blog post as a prompt.
