# ðŸ’– Core Exercise: Gratitude

Inside a blog post, briefly (or extensively if you want) jot down answers to the following questions:

- Reflect on the goals you set out to achieve in Week 1. Have you worked towards achieved them? How did they change as the course progressed?
- Look back on what you thought the biggest challenge would be - was it that or something else?
- What have you learned from the course? Pick 2 or 3 key things to talk about.
- What are you most excited to continue learning about in future courses?
- Include a picture of something - can be anything.

Once you've done this, go and thank three people who helped you throughout the course. It might be your tutor, your project teammates, or your friends and family who supported you.
