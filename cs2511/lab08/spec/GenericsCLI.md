| **Command**                                            | **Behaviour**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `tick`                                                 | progresses the simulation by 1 day. Each day, a new sunflower is received, and every second day, a new rose is received. Flowers in flower boxes also grow a little each day until they are ready to harvest.                                                                                                                        |
| `plant <rose\|sunflower>` E.g., `plant rose`           | plants the specified flower in the flowerbox if that flower type is available. In the v3 package, this plants the flower in the standard flower box                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `harvest <rose\|sunflower>` E.g., `harvest sunflower`  | For the chosen type of flower, harvests all of the flowers that are ready to be harvested from the flower box. Harvesting sunflowers collects their seeds. Harvesting roses reveals their hidden message. Harvested flowers get automatically added to the batch of flowers to be sold in the next invocation of the `sell` command. |
| `log`                                                  | prints the log of messages that have been revealed from harvested flowers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `sell`                                                 | sells all of the flowers that have been added to the package of flowers to be sold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `package <rose\|sunflower>` [N] E.g., `package rose 3` | Adds the chosen flower which is not in a flower box to the package of flowers to be sold. Has an optional number argument to package multiple flowers at once. When using seedlings, this will instead add a seedling of the chosen type to the package to be sold.                                                                  |
| `mutate <rose\|sunflower>` [N] E.g., `mutate rose 3`   | Only for v3. Like plant but adds the chosen flower type to the mutated flower box, where the harvested flower will have a mutation. Has an optional number argument to add multiple flowers to the mutated flower box at once.                                                                                                       |
| `s`                                                    | toggles whether display should occur after each command. `s` short for `suppress`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `d`                                                    | Manually display the current state of the simulation. Useful if output suppression is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `q`                                                    | End the simulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
