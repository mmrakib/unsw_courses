Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.

The answer is B.

This is because a post-order traversal will start from 2, then go to 8 before going to 7, eliminating A, C and D.

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root): 32

Value in the right child (of the root): 39

(c) Give the rotations that are performed (if any) as a result of
    inserting each value.

When 25 is inserted, the tree is rotated at node 22 since the height of the right subtree is 2 more than the left.
This causes a left rotation at node 22.

When 8 is inserted, the tree is rotated at node 5 since the height of the right subtree is 2 more than the left.
This causes first a right rotation on 13, then a left rotation on 5.
