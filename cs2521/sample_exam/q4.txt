Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

It can only be Kruskal's algorithm, because it's the only algorithm that adds edges to the empty minimum spanning tree globally.
Prim's algorithm starts from a node, then expands out based off of all edges that are incident to currently traversed nodes. 
However, since C-D got added right after A-E, and C-D is not connected to A-E, only Kruskal's could've done this. 
Same with DFS, which traverse to adjacent nodes via incident edges, and therefore also could not have been used here because of the jump.
