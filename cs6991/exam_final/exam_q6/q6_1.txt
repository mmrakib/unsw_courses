I think it's feasible to write real-world Rust programs without using any unsafe code, including dependencies.

Rust's has a powerfultype system and owernship model whih allows developers like myself to write efficient and 
robust apps that are entirely within the safe subset of the language. The `std` and many popular crates provide 
safe abstractions over low-level oeprations.

I do admit that there are places where writing unsafe code might be challenging:

First, [eformance critical sections that require very fine-grained control over memory and performance only possible 
with unsafe code.

Second, lowl level system programming that necessitate unsafe code.

Out side of these particular applications, I believe we can write safe code all the way through and still have an 
amazing safe AND fast program out of it!

Unsafe Rust allows you to bypass many of the compiler's safety checks, thus granting more control
but also introducing potential risks. You leave yourself open to memory safety violations like null pointer dereferences, 
dangling references, buffer overflows, data races and so forth. You also leave yourself open to undefined behaviour, crashes, 
and security vulnerabilities. 

In order to avoid these pitfalls, I believe you should keep unsafe Rust encapsulated into well-confined, well-audited blocks 
with safe interfaces. I also think extensive code review and testing of these unsafe blocks are necessary. Best practices and 
idiomatic code aid in this endavour.
